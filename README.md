# üåê General Functions
this has features like getting videos, rotating proxies, automatic actions, etc.
- Cookie Support
  - Can add cookies from your browser via extension, and then write to txt file. The bot will then sort them to be in a big list.
  - Cycles through cookie sets, adds to browser each instance.
  - When an instance ends, it uses any others detected, so to make sure that it uses all cookies in the file.

- Rotating Proxy support
  - Skips some if it doesn't work, some might other times, but to make this better we skip ones that don't load the pages quick enough.
  - Cycles through them afer each browser instance to make sure that when another cookie set is added, we use a proxy that hasn't been used before, we can test the bad ones again to see if they work.
- Video Scraping
  - Get random set of videos from a channel, sort, parse.
 
- Comment bot
  - Use Top to Bottom or Random comments on videos scraped.
    
- WatchTime
  - Watches 1/2 of a video before performing actions, can be changed.
  - Rewinds random parts of videos.
    
- SubBot
  - Subscribes to your channel after watching nearly all of the video (use @ risk).
    You can set certain video URL's to sub to incase one goes viral; hiding bot behaviour.
  - Subscribe to your channel in general.
    Not reccomended unless it's an attack against someone else to "expose" them for fake subs.
