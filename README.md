# üåê General Functions
this has features like getting videos, rotating proxies, automatic actions, etc.
- Cookie Support
  - Can add cookies from your browser via extension, and then write to txt file. The bot will then sort them to be in a big list.
  - Cycles through cookie sets, adds to browser each instance.
  - When an instance ends, it uses any others detected, so to make sure that it uses all cookies in the file.

- Rotating Proxy support
  - Skips some if it doesn't work, some might other times, but to make this better we skip ones that don't load the pages quick enough.
  - Cycles through them afer each browser instance to make sure that when another cookie set is added, we use a proxy that hasn't been used before, we can test the bad ones again to see if they work.
- Video Scraping
  - Get random set of videos from a channel, sort, parse.
 
- Comment bot
  - Use Top to Bottom or Random comments on videos scraped.
  - Auto like other comments
  - Reply to comments (same logic as adding comments).
    
- WatchTime
  - Watches 1/2 of a video before performing actions, can be changed.
  - Rewinds random parts of videos.
    
- SubBot
  - Subscribes to your channel after watching nearly all of the video (use @ risk).
    You can set certain video URL's to sub to incase one goes viral; hiding bot behaviour.
  - Subscribe to your channel in general.
    Not reccomended unless it's an attack against someone else to "expose" them for fake subs.
    
- Promotion Bot
  - Comment on other videos in your nieche to get viewers to your videos (random channels from list).
    Can be set to non-obvious or obvious, where option1 compliments but also slides your channel in the comment, option2 being it will say your channel without caring about morals to other creators.

This is a private project, I only allow certain people to use this, unless given permission by me to sell this, then you can't give to other people unless you know them well e.g friends & family.
Cracking is prohibited. If you crack this then you're wasting your time since I'm constantly updating this and so if you wanted to crack then sure, but you won't wanna waste so much time; Idrc.

In no way do I condone bots on any platform, this is just to benefit myself and others in a non-malicious way. We are simply testing on our own channels and understand the risks of ToS.
